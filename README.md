Using machine learning approaches, we will investigate the task of classifying tweets as "normal" or "suicidal" in this notebook. "Suicidal" tweets are those that discuss or mention suicide, while "normal" tweets are those that are not. The dataset is made up of labeled tweets. To create a strong model for this classification problem, we'll make use of the potent XGBoost classifier.
